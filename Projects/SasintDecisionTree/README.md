# Sasint Decision tree project
This is a project for a man named Sasint.
He is annoying so I am just finishing this off for him.
```python
# Modules needed to run this project successfully
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```
Use pip install 'package name' to install these 2 packages.
