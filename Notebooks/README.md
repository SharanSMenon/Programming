# Notebooks folder
This folder contains all of my jupyter notebooks that I created. 

If you want to view the notebook, you can either click on them or click this [link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SharanSMenon/Programming-Folder/tree/master/) 

In order to see graphs made by the [Plotly](http://plot.ly) library, please click the link from the previous paragraph

These packages are required for this code to work:
```python
import matploylib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import plotly.offline as plty
import sklearn
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from plotly.graph_objs import *
import cufflinks as cf
```
## Thank you for taking your time
